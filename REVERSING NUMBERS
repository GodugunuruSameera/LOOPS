Write a program which reads a sequence and prints it in the reverse order.

Input
The input is given in the following format:

n
a1 a2 . . . an
n is the size of the sequence and ai is the ith element of the sequence.

Output
Print the reversed sequence in a line. Print a single space character between adjacent elements (Note that your program should not put a space character after the last element).

Constraints
n ≤ 100
0 ≤ ai < 1000

CODE:
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = sc.nextInt();
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            System.out.print(a[i]);
            if (i != 0) System.out.print(" ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
