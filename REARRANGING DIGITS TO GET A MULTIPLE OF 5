Given a positive integer 
N
N, MoEngage wants you to determine if it is possible to rearrange the digits of 
N
N (in decimal representation) and obtain a multiple of 
5
5.

For example, when 
N
=
108
N=108, we can rearrange its digits to construct 
180
=
36
⋅
5
180=36⋅5 which is a multiple of 
5
5.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
T
T, the number of test cases. The description of the 
T
T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines
The first line contains a single integer 
D
D, the number of digits in 
N
N.
The second line consists of a string of length 
D
D, the number 
N
N (in decimal representation). It is guaranteed that the string does not contain leading zeroes and consists only of the characters 
0
,
1
,
…
9
0,1,…9.
Output Format
For each test case, print 
Yes
Yes if it is possible to rearrange the digits of 
N
N so that it becomes a multiple 
5
5. Otherwise, print 
No
No.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings 
YeS
YeS, 
yEs
yEs, 
yes
yes and 
YES
YES will all be treated as identical).

**Test Case 
1
1:** The given number is already divisible by 
5
5, therefore the answer is 
Yes
Yes.
Test Case 2: We can obtain 
310
=
62
⋅
5
310=62⋅5 by rearranging the digits of 
103
103, so the answer is 
Yes
Yes.

Test Case 3: The only numbers that can be obtained by rearranging the digits of 
119
119 are 
{
119
,
191
,
911
}
{119,191,911}. None of these numbers are multiples of 
5
5, so the answer is 
No
No.
CODE:
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = sc.nextInt();

        while (T-- > 0) {
            int D = sc.nextInt();  
            String N = sc.next();  

            boolean possible = false;

            for (int i = 0; i < D; i++) {
                char ch = N.charAt(i);

                if (ch == '0' || ch == '5') {
                    possible = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (possible)
                System.out.println("Yes");
            else
                System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
