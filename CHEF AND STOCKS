​
  denotes the profit earned by Chef on the 
i
t
h
i 
th
  day.
Note that 
A
i
<
0
A 
i
​
 <0 indicates that Chef had a loss on the

t
h
i 
th
  day.

Chef wants to find the maximum amount of of profit he would have earned, if he skipped trading for exactly one day.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains 
N
N — the number of days.
The next line denotes 
N
N space-separated integers, denoting the profit earned by Chef on the 
i
t
h
i 
th
  day.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum amount of of profit he would have earned, if he skipped trading for exactly one day.
