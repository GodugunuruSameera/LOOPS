Taro and Hanako are playing card games. They have n cards each, and they compete n turns. At each turn Taro and Hanako respectively puts out a card. The name of the animal consisting of alphabetical letters is written on each card, and the bigger one in lexicographical order becomes the winner of that turn. The winner obtains 3 points. In the case of a draw, they obtain 1 point each.

Write a program which reads a sequence of cards Taro and Hanako have and reports the final scores of the game.

Input
In the first line, the number of cards n is given. In the following n lines, the cards for n turns are given respectively. For each line, the first string represents the Taro's card and the second one represents Hanako's card.

Constraints
n ≤ 1000
The length of the string ≤ 100
Output
Print the final scores of Taro and Hanako respectively. Put a single space character between them.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String t = sc.next();
            String h = sc.next();

            if (t.compareTo(h) > 0) {
                taro += 3;
            } else if (t.compareTo(h) < 0) {
                hanako += 3;
            } else {
                taro += 1;
                hanako += 1;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(taro + " " + hanako);
