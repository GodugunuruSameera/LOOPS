Chef has a special ability: he can use both his left and right hands equally well, and at the same time!

To put this ability into practice, Chef decides that he’s going to write a novel with his left hand, while writing code with his right.

Chef needs 
L
L minutes to write a page with his left hand, and 
R
R minutes to write a line of code with his right.
Chef defines his satisfaction to be the number of pages he’s started writing, plus the number of lines of code he’s finished writing.

What will Chef’s satisfaction be after 
M
M minutes?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case will contain three space-separated integers 
L
,
R
,
L,R, and 
M
M — Chef writing speed, coding speed, and the number of minutes he has.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer: Chef’s satisfaction after 
M
M minutes.

**Test case 
1
1:** Here, 
L
=
2
,
R
=
4
,
M
=
8
L=2,R=4,M=8. After 
8
8 minutes, Chef will have exactly completed 
4
4 pages and 
2
2 lines of code, so his satisfaction is 
4
+
2
=
6
4+2=6.
Test case 
2
2: Here, 
L
=
3
,
R
=
4
,
M
=
6
L=3,R=4,M=6.
After 
6
6 minutes, Chef will have exactly completed 
2
2 pages. He’ll also have completed one line of code, and will be in the middle of writing the second.
So, his satisfaction is 
2
+
1
=
3
2+1=3 — incomplete lines of code don’t count towards satisfaction.

Test case 
3
3: Here, 
L
=
4
,
R
=
3
,
M
=
6
L=4,R=3,M=6.
After 
6
6 minutes, Chef will have completed one page, and will be in the middle of writing the second. He’ll also have exactly completed 
2
2 lines of code.
So, his satisfaction is 
2
+
2
=
4
2+2=4 — incomplete (but started) pages do count towards satisfaction.
CODE:
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = sc.nextInt();

        while (T-- > 0) {
            int L = sc.nextInt();
            int R = sc.nextInt();
            int M = sc.nextInt();

            int pages = M / L;
            if (M % L != 0)
                pages++;

            int lines = M / R;

            System.out.println(pages + lines);
        }
    }
}
